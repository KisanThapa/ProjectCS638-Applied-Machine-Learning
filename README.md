# CS638 Applied Machine Learning (Final Project)
In this project, I am going to build a machine learning model to classify whether a gene is mutated or not based on its read count. As genes mutate so frequently, some mutations are harmful some are not. As we have many datasets already available about the gene mutations. So if we can detect gene is mutated or not of a patient using machine learning models, we can infer other information about the patient like suggesting a similar type of treatment to other patients who also have the same mutation. 

Using gene expression dataset from RNASeq and mutation status of the gene from mutation analysis, a gene may be classified into mutated or not mutated.
